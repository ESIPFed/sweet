# Motivation
Please describe the driving motivation behind your proposed alignment.

# Existing alignments
Please check out the [existing alignment graphs](https://github.com/ESIPFed/sweet/tree/master/alignments) to make sure an alignment does not  already exist. If it does then consider editing or updating the alignment rather than providing a new one.
Additionally, please follow the same style, especially for metadata such that we have some homogeneity throughout the style of SWEET alignments. 

# Tooling
Have a look at the [SWEET Alignment Manager](https://github.com/ESIPFed/sweet-tools/tree/master/sweet-alignment-manager) which you may use to generate an initial alignment.
