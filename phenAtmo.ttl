On Earth, sunlight is filtered through the atmosphere, and the solar radiation is obvious as daylight when the Sun is above the horizon. This is usually during the hours known as day. Near the poles in summer, sunlight also occurs during the hours known as night and in the winter at the poles sunlight may not occur at any time. When the direct radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced as sunshine, a combination of bright light and heat. Radiant heat directly produced by the radiation of the sun is different from the increase in atmospheric temperature due to the radiative heating of the atmosphere by the sun's radiation."@en ;

Because the troposphere is statically stable on the average (i.e., potential temperature increases with height), and because turbulence in the boundary layer causes potential temperatures to become somewhat well mixed there, conservation of heat requires that there be a potential temperature increase (i.e., a temperature step or inversion) at the top of the boundary layer. It is this inversion that separates the boundary layer from the rest of the troposphere by limiting the domain of turbulence. It is also responsible for trapping pollutants near the ground during fair weather."@en ;

In mid- to late morning, the top of the mixed layer exhibits rapid rise as heating eliminates the nocturnal inversion, and the mixed layer grows through the residual layer.
