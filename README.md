# Introduction
Official repository for Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (SWEET) Ontologies.

# What is SWEET?
SWEET is a highly modular ontology suite with ~6000 concepts in ~200 separate ontologies covering Earth system science. SWEET is a mid-level ontology and consists of nine top-level concepts that can be used as a foundation for domain-specific ontologies that extend these top-level SWEET components. SWEETâ€™s own domain-specific ontologies, which extend the upper level ontologies, can provide users interested in further developing a particular domain with a solid set of concepts to get started. SWEET ontologies are written in [W3C Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/); the Terse RDF Triple Language and are publicly available under the [Apache License v2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

# Live OWL Documentation Environment
[Live OWL Documentation Environment](http://www.github.com/essepuntato/LODE) (LODE), is a service that automatically extracts classes, object properties, data properties, named individuals, annotation properties, general axioms and namespace declarations from an OWL and OWL2 ontology, and renders them as ordered lists, together with their textual definitions, in a human-readable HTML page designed for browsing and navigation by means of embedded links.

We use LODE to render SWEET in a human readable manner. For user browsing convenience, we cache the LODE visualizations and make them available at
