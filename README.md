# Introduction
Official repository for Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (SWEET) Ontologies.

# What is SWEET?
SWEET is a highly modular ontology suite with ~6000 concepts in ~200 separate ontologies covering Earth system science. SWEET is a mid-level ontology and consists of nine top-level concepts that can be used as a foundation for domain-specific ontologies that extend these top-level SWEET components. SWEET’s own domain-specific ontologies, which extend the upper level ontologies, can provide users interested in further developing a particular domain with a solid set of concepts to get started. SWEET ontologies are written in [W3C Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/); the Terse RDF Triple Language and are publicly available under the [Apache License v2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
