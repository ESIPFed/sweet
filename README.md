# Introduction
Official repository for Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (SWEET) Ontologies.

## Accessing SWEET (base ontology)
This table provides links to access the base SWEET ontology, which contains import directives to bring in all the other ontologies. 
If you want to browse the entire content SWEET, see the next section below.

## Accessing SWEET (all content)
To View all SWEET content, you either need to open the base ontology in an ontology tool like Protégé or TopBraid, 
or you can view the contents in an ontology browser like BioPortal. Links for the latter are provided in the following table.

Unfortunately, as of March 2022 there is a 'middleware service bug' (we think in CloudFlare, the ESIP service provider)
that prevents tools using Java 8 from performing the necessary uploads of the subsidiary ontologies of SWEET. 
Since Protégé uses Java 8 (for at least a few more months), it will not automatically load all the SWEET ontologies.

# What is SWEET?
SWEET is a highly modular ontology suite with ~6000 concepts in ~200 separate ontologies covering Earth system science. SWEET is a mid-level ontology and consists of nine top-level concepts that can be used as a foundation for domain-specific ontologies that extend these top-level SWEET components. SWEET’s own domain-specific ontologies, which extend the upper level ontologies, can provide users interested in further developing a particular domain with a solid set of concepts to get started. SWEET ontologies are written in [W3C Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/); the Terse RDF Triple Language.

# Using local copies of ontology
The sweetall.ttl ontology imports all the other sweet components via URL. If you are offline, or working on updates that require using the local copies of the ontology files, copy the catalog-v001.xml file from the root directory of the repository into the src directory before opening sweetAll.ttl in Protege.
