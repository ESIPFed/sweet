    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A heterogeneous or conglomerate is a rock consisting of individual stones that have become cemented together. Conglomerates are sedimentary rocks consisting of rounded fragments and are thus differentiated from breccias, which consist of angular clasts.[1] Both conglomerates and breccias are characterized by clasts larger than sand (>2 mm).

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A mélange is a large scale breccia, a mappable body of rock characterized by a lack of continuous bedding and the inclusion of fragments of rock of all sizes, contained in a fine-grained deformed matrix. The mélange typically consists of a jumble of large blocks of varied lithologies of altered oceanic crustal material and blocks of continental slope sediments in a sheared mudstone matrix. Some larger blocks of rock may be as much as 1 km across. [Wikipedia]</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Meteoric substances are rocks that have composition significantly different from earth rocks. Meteorites have traditionally been divided into three broad categories: stony meteorites are rocks, mainly composed of silicate minerals; iron meteorites are largely composed of metallic iron-nickel; and, stony-iron meteorites contain large amounts of both metallic and rocky material.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Molasse refers to the sandstones, shales and conglomerates formed as terrestrial or shallow marine deposits in front of rising mountain chains deposited in a foreland basin, especially on top of flysch, for example that left from the rising Alps, or erosion in the Himalaya. These deposits are typically the non-marine alluvial and fluvial sediments of lowlands, as compared to deep-water flysch sediments. Sedimentation stops once the orogeny stops, or once the mountains have eroded flat. [Wikipedia]</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">One of 3 processes in the Rock Cycle. When wind or water deposit fine grained material on the surface, it creates sheets. Over thousands of years, the composition can change subtly or distinctly and the result is differing compositions of layered deposits. As the overlying layers compact the soil underneath the soil is converted to rock by the process of lithification. [Wikipedia]</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A substantial break or gap in the geologic record where a rock unit is overlain by another that is not next in stratigraphic sucession, such as an interruption in continuity of a depositional sequence of sedimentary rocks or a break between eroded igneous rocks and younger sedimentary strata. It results from a change that caused deposition to cease for a considerable time, and it normally implies uplift and erosion with loss of the previous formed record.</rdfs:comment>
