At night under clear skies, radiation to space cools the land surface, which in turn cools the adjacent air through processes of molecular conduction, turbulence, and radiative transfer. This causes a stable boundary layer to form and grow to depths of a few hundreds of meters, depending on the season. Many interacting processes can occur within the statically stable nocturnal boundary layer: patchy sporadic turbulence, internal gravity waves, drainage flows, inertial oscillations, and nocturnal jets."@en ;
