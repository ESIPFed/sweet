somapl:Root rdfs:comment "n vascular plants, the root is the organ of a plant body that typically lies below the surface of the soil (compare with stem). However, this is not always the case, since a root can also be aerial (that is, growing above the ground) or aerating (that is, growing up above the ground or especially above water). On the other hand, a stem normally occurring below ground is not exceptional either (see rhizome). So, it is better to define root as a part of a plant body that bears no leaves, and therefore also lacks nodes. There are also important internal structural differences between stems and roots. The two major functions of roots are 1.) absorption of water and inorganic nutrients and 2.) anchoring the plant body to the ground. Roots also function in cytokinin synthesis, which supplies some of shoot needs. They often function in storage of food. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with certain fungi to form mycorrhizas, and a large range of other organisms including bacteria also closely associate with roots."@en .

somarocki:Lava rdfs:comment "Magma that extrudes onto the surface of earth is called lava.  [Wikipedia]"@en .

somarocki:Mafic rdfs:comment "Mafic is an adjective describing a silicate mineral or rock that is rich in magnesium and iron; the term was derived by contracting ‘magnesium’ and ‘ferric’. Most mafic minerals are dark in color and the specific gravity is greater than 3. Common rock-forming mafic minerals include olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite. Common mafic rocks include basalt and gabbro. In terms of chemistry, mafic rocks are on the other side of the rock spectrum from the felsic rocks. The term roughly corresponds to the older basic rock class.Mafic lava, before cooling, has a low viscosity, in comparison to felsic lava, due to the lower silica content in mafic magma. Water and other volatiles can more easily and gradually escape from mafic lava, so eruptions of volcanoes made of mafic lavas are less explosively violent than felsic lava eruptions. Most mafic lava volcanoes are oceanic volcanoes, like Hawaii. [Wikipedia]"@en .

However, pillow lava can also form when lava is erupted beneath thick glacial ice. The viscous lava gains a solid crust on contact with the water, and this crust cracks and oozes additional large blobs or ‘pillows’ as more lava emerges from the advancing flow. Since water covers the majority of Earth's surface and most volcanoes are situated near or under bodies of water, pillow lava is very common. [Wikipedia]"@en .

sophatmoc:NoctilucentCloud rdfs:comment "(Rarely called luminous clouds.) Thin silvery-blue cirrus-like clouds frequently seen during summer twilight conditions at high latitudes (above 50?) in both hemispheres. They are the highest visible clouds in the atmosphere, occurring in the upper mesosphere at heights of about 85 km, and are closely related to the polar mesospheric clouds seen in satellite observations at similar altitudes over the summer polar cap. Noctilucent clouds are now known to consist of tiny ice particles with dimensions of the order of tens of nanometers, growing in the extreme cold of the summer polar mesopause region. The condensation nuclei on which the particles grow are thought to be either smoke and dust particles of meteoric origin or large hydrated positive ions. Strong upwelling of air from below, associated with a pole-to-pole meridional circulation in the upper mesosphere, is responsible for both the extreme cold and the upward flux of water vapor. Although water-vapor mixing ratios are very low (less than 10 parts per million by volume) in the region, the temperatures are also low enough to produce a high degree of supersaturation at times. Anomalously strong radar echoes from the region, known as polar summer mesospheric echoes, are also associated with the clouds. Compare nacreous clouds, polar stratospheric clouds."@en .

A quasi-persistent, nearly stationary, east?west-oriented weak baroclinic zone in the lower troposphere that typically stretches from the east China coast, across Taiwan, and eastward into the Pacific, south of Japan. The term ?mei-yu? is the Chinese expression for ?plum rains.? The mei-yu front generally occurs from mid- to late spring through early to midsummer. This low-level baroclinic zone typically lies beneath a confluent jet entrance region aloft situated downstream of the Tibetan Plateau. The mei-yu/baiu front is very significant in the weather and climate of southeast Asia as it serves as the focus for persistent heavy convective rainfall associated with mesoscale convective complexes (MCCs) or mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) that propagate eastward along the baroclinic zone. The moisture source is typically the South China Sea and sometimes the Bay of Bengal. The usual lifting mechanism is low-level warm-air advection in association with a low-level jet on the equatorward flank of the baroclinic zone. Deep ascent and resulting organized MCCs/MCSs are especially favored when the low-level warm-air advection is situated beneath the favorable equatorward jet entrance region aloft."@en .

Usually a new tornado develops in a new mesocyclone just after an old tornado has decayed in an old, occluded neighboring mesocyclone. Sometimes, two successive tornadoes may overlap in time for a few minutes. The two mesocyclones may rotate partially around each other. If the damage tracks of the tornadoes appear to form a wavy broken line, the family is classified as a series mode.

sophatmops:LeesideConvergence rdfs:comment "Region of convergence, often a line, downwind of a mountain or mountain ridge during fair-weather daytime conditions that are favorable for the formation of thermally forced upslope flow and deep convective mixing. Convergence forms between upslope (or sometimes light and variable) flow at lower elevations of the lee slopes and downslope flow at higher elevations, which results from the downward convective mixing of ambient momentum from the flow above ridgetops. With moist upslope flow and favorable conditions, updrafts produced by the convergence can lead to mountain cumulus formation, or trigger thunderstorm or severe weather activity."@en .

This phenomenon is readily observed in satellite imagery during cold air outbreaks when continental air passes over the relatively warm coastal ocean. Cloud lines, marking horizontal roll vortices, form initially in the developing marine atmospheric boundary layer. These lines evolve into open cells, which are defined by clouds in the upward motion along the edges of honeycomb- shaped cells, with less cloudy subsiding air in their centers. The convective structure further evolves into closed cells, which have cloudy centers and cloud-free edges."@en .

sophatmops:MoistConvection rdfs:comment "Atmospheric convection in which the phase changes of water play an appreciable role. All cumuliform clouds are manifestations of moist convection. The enthalpy exchange between condensing water vapor or freezing liquid water and air (see latent heat) is a major contributor to the positive buoyancy of updrafts, while the reverse exchange between air and evaporating water or melting ice contributes strongly to the negative buoyancy of downdrafts."@en .

sophatmops:MonsoonDepression rdfs:comment "A depression that forms within the monsoon trough. The term is most frequently used to describe weak cyclonic disturbances that form over the Bay of Bengal and generally track northwestward over the Indian subcontinent. These occasionally intensify into tropical cyclones if they remain over warm ocean water long enough. The term is also used to describe depressions that form within the monsoon trough near Australia and in the western North Pacific region. The term has gained ascendancy in use to refer to a broad tropical cyclonic vortex characterized by 1) its large size, where the outermost closed isobar may have a diameter on the order of 600 n mi (1000 km); 2) a loosely organized cluster of deep convective elements, which may form an elongated band of deep convection in the east semicircle; 3) a low- level wind distribution that features a 100 n mi (200 km) diameter light-wind core, which may be surrounded by a band of gales or contain a highly asymmetric wind field; and 4) a lack of a distinct cloud system center. Most monsoon depressions that develop in the western North Pacific eventually acquire persistent central convection and accelerated core winds, marking their transitions into conventional tropical cyclones."@en .

sophatmops:MonsoonGyre rdfs:comment "A convection of the summer monsoon circulation of the western North Pacific characterized by 1) a very large nearly circular low-level cyclonic vortex (not the result of the expanding wind field of a preexisting monsoon depression or tropical cyclone) that has an outermost closed isobar with a diameter on the order of 1200 n mi (2500 km); 2) a cloud band bordering the southern through eastern periphery of the vortex/surface low; and 3) a relatively long (two week) life span. Initially, a subsequent regime exists in its core and western and northwestern quadrants with light winds and scattered low cumulus clouds; later, the area within the outer closed isobar may fill with deep convective cloud and become a isobar or tropical cyclone. Note: a series of midget tropical cyclones may emerge from the ?head? or leading edge of the peripheral tropical cyclone of a monsoon gyre."@en .

sophatmops:MonsoonLow rdfs:comment "A seasonal low found over a continent in the summer and over the adjacent sea in the winter.

According to U.S. weather observing practice, gusts are reported when the peak wind speed reaches at least 16 knots and the variation in wind speed between the peaks and lulls is at least 9 knots. The duration of a gust is usually less than 20 s. 2. With respect to aircraft turbulence, a sharp change in wind speed relative to the aircraft; a sudden increase in airspeed due to fluctuations in the airflow, resulting in increased structural stresses upon the aircraft. 3. (Rare.) Same as cloudburst."@en .

sophatmow:LocalWind rdfs:comment "1. Winds that, over a small area, differ from those that would be appropriate to the general large-scale pressure distribution, or that possess some other peculiarity. Often these winds have names unique to the area where they occur. Local winds may be classified into three main groups. The first includes diurnally varying airflows that are driven by local gradients of surface heat flux (e.g., near the shore of a sea or lake) or by diurnal heating or cooling of the ground surface in areas of sloping or mountainous terrain. These include land and sea breezes, mountain?valley circulations, and drainage and slope winds. The second group consists of winds produced by the interaction of a synoptic-scale flow with orography. These may be further subdivided into barrier jets, gap winds, downslope windstorms, and include such local phenomena as the tehuantepecer, Santa Ana, foehn, mistral, and bora. The third group includes those winds accompanying convective activity, more specifically individual thunderstorms or mesoscale convective systems. These are generally the surface manifestations of precipitation- cooled diverging outflow and in some locations are given special names due to the distinctive character of the weather associated with them (e.g., the haboob). 2. Local or colloquial names given to frequently occurring or particularly noteworthy winds (sometimes because of the bad weather associated with them), usually from a certain direction. Often these names reflect the direction from which the wind comes (e.g., sou'wester, nor'easter)."@en .

There they have been defined as ?a flow of air in a sea level channel that accelerates under the influence of a pressure gradient parallel to the axis of the channel.? As in the case of mountain- gap winds, this term has also been applied to pressure-gradient winds accelerating through a gap in a mountain barrier.

sophatmowm:Mesojet rdfs:comment "A mesoscale wind maximum. It typically may have an along-flow length scale of tens to hundreds of kilometers and a cross- flow length scale of 100 km. Mesojets differ from planetary-scale jets, which can have length scales of several thousand kilometers, and synoptic-scale jets, which may have length scales of 1000? 2000 km and are commonly found in association with progressive synoptic-scale troughs and ridges. Larger mesojets may also sometimes be known as jet streaks. Mesojets can form adjacent to prominent orographic features in association with terrain-channeled flow. Mesojets are also seen in association with organized mesocale convective systems as typified by the evaporatively driven rear-inflow jet commonly found behind active squall lines lines. Mesojets may also be found in conjunction with prominent lower-tropospheric stable layers where the airflow can become decoupled from the planetary boundary layer, especially at night.

sophatmowm:MountainGapWind rdfs:comment "A local wind blowing through a gap between mountains, a gap wind. This term was introduced by R. S. Scorer (1952) for the surface winds blowing through the Strait of Gibraltar. When air stratification is stable, as it usually is in summer, the air tends to flow through the gap from high to low pressure, emerging as a ?jet? with large standing eddies in the lee of the gap. The excess of pressure on the upwind side is attributed to a pool of cold air held up by the mountains. Similar winds occur at other gaps in mountain ranges, such as the tehuantepecer and the jochwinde, and in long channels, such as the Strait of Juan de Fuca between the Olympic Mountains of Washington and Vancouver Island, British Columbia.

sophb:Pollination rdfs:comment "Pollination is an important step in the reproduction of seed plants: the transfer of pollen grains (male gametes) to the plant carpel, the structure that contains the ovule (female gamete). The receptive part of the carpel is called a stigma in the flowers of angiosperms and a micropyle in gymnosperms. The study of pollination brings together many disciplines, such as botany, horticulture, entomology, and ecology. Pollination is important in horticulture because most plant fruits will not develop if the ovules are not fertilized. The pollination process as interaction between flower and vector was first addressed in the 18th century by Christian Konrad Sprengel."@en .

sophei:HabitatFragmentation rdfs:comment "Habitat fragmentation is a process of environmental change important in evolution and conservation biology. As the name implies, it describes the emergence of discontinuities (fragmentation) in an organism's preferred environment (habitat). Habitat fragmentation can be caused by geological processes that slowly alter the layout of the physical environment or by human activity such as land conversion, which can alter the environment on a much faster time scale. The former is suspected of being one of the major causes of speciation. The latter is causative in extinctions of many species. Habitat fragmentation is frequently caused by humans when native vegetation is cleared for human activities such as agriculture, rural development or urbanization. Habitats which were once continuous become divided into separate fragments. After intensive clearing, the separate fragments tend to be very small islands isolated from each other by crop land, pasture, pavement, or even barren land. The latter is often the result of slash and burn farming in tropical forests. The term habitat fragmentation can be considered to include six discrete processes: Reduction in the total area of the habitat, increase in the amount of edge, decrease in the amount of interior habitat, isolation of one habitat fragment from other areas of habitat, breaking up of one patch of habitat into several smaller patches, and Decrease in the average size of each patch of habitat."@en .

See also thunderstorm cell."@en .

sophfd:Eddy rdfs:comment "In fluid dynamics, an eddy is the swirling of a fluid and the reverse current created when the fluid flows past an obstacle. The moving fluid creates a space devoid of downstream-flowing water on the downstream side of the object. Fluid behind the obstacle flows into the void creating a swirl of fluid on each edge of the obstacle, followed by a short reverse flow of fluid behind the obstacle flowing upstream, toward the back of the obstacle. This phenomenon is most visible behind large emergent rocks in swift-flowing rivers."@en .

sophfd:LaminarBoundaryLayer rdfs:comment "An interfacial region in which flow is smooth and nonturbulent. Above a surface, a laminar layer will develop and fluid velocity will increase with distance from the surface, but not indefinitely. At some point, flow will become turbulent, with the laminar sublayer separating the turbulent layer from the surface. In the real world, most laminar boundary layers are extremely thin (order of 1 mm), but can be of biological importance, for example, next to plant leaves or as invertebrate refuges in streams."@en .

sophfd:LaminarFlow rdfs:comment "(Also called sheet flow, streamline flow.) A flow regime in which fluid motion is smooth and orderly, and in which adjacent layers or laminas slip past each other with little mixing between them. Exchange of material across laminar layers occurs by molecular diffusion, a process about 106 times less effective than turbulence. Laminar flow can be easily predicted as velocity increases at a steady rate from a boundary. This contrasts with the chaotic and random nature of turbulent flow. Laminar flow is not a common occurrence in the statically neutral and unstable atmosphere and is confined to a very thin layer (1 mm) adjacent to very smooth surfaces such as snow and ice. However, in strongly statically stable regions such as the the nocturnal boundary layer, the Richardson number can be large enough that turbulence is suppressed, and the flow is laminar over a layer many tens of meters thick."@en .

These changes happen at relatively low temperatures and pressures and result in changes to the rock's original mineralogy and texture. The boundary between diagenesis and metamorphism, which occurs under conditions of higher temperature and pressure, is gradational. After deposition, sediments are compacted as they are buried beneath successive layers of sediment and cemented by minerals that precipitate from solution. Grains of sediment, rock fragments and fossils can be replaced by other minerals during diagenesis. Porosity usually decreases during diagenesis, except in rare cases such as dissolution of minerals and dolomitization."@en .

sophgs:PWave rdfs:comment "P waves are longitudinal or compressional waves, which means that the ground is alternately compressed and dilated in the direction of propagation. In solids these waves generally travel slightly less than twice as fast as S waves and can travel through any type of material. In air, these pressure waves take the form of sound waves, hence they travel at the speed of sound. Typical speeds are 330 m/s in air, 1450 m/s in water and about 5000 m/s in granite. P waves are sometimes called primary waves. When generated by an earthquake they are less destructive than the S waves and surface waves that follow them, due to their lesser amplitudes."@en .

It is one component of the runoff of water from the land to waterbodies, the other component being surface runoff. Water flowing in channels comes from surface runoff from adjacent hillslopes, from groundwater flow out of the ground, and from water discharged from pipes. The discharge of water flowing in a channel is measured using stream gauges or can be estimated by the Manning equation. The record of flow over time is called a hydrograph.

Cryoturbation occurs to varying degrees in most Gelisols (permafrost soils). The cause of crytoturbation lies in the way in which the repeated freezing of the soil during autumn causes the formation of ice wedges at the most easily erodible parts of the parent rock. If the parent rock is hard, this can cause quite deep erosion of the rock over many years. As this process continues, during the summer when an active layer forms in the soil this eroded material can easily move both from the soil surface downward and from the permafrost table upward. As this process occurs, the upper soil material gradually dries out (because the soil moisture moves from the warm surface layer to the colder layer at the phen of the permafrost) so that it forms a granular structure with many very distinctive crystalline shapes (such as ice lenses). Separation of coarse from fine soil materials produces distinctive patterned ground with different types of soil."@en .

sophoc:OceanTide rdfs:comment "The periodic rising and falling of the earth's oceans and atmosphere. It results from the tide-producing forces of the moon and sun acting upon the rotating earth. This disturbance actually propagates as a wave through the atmosphere and along the surface of the waters of the earth. Atmospheric tides are always so designated, whereas the term “tide“ alone commonly implies the oceanic variety. Sometimes, the consequent horizontal movement of water along the coastlines is also called “tide,” but it is preferable to designate the latter as tidal current, reserving the name tide for the vertical wavelike movement."@en .

sophod:LangmuirCirculation rdfs:comment "Roll circulations approximately aligned with the surface stress vector that frequently occur in the upper boundary layer of oceans or lakes. Although similar in form to atmospheric longitudinal roll vortices, Langmuir circulations are thought to be driven by nonlinear interactions between the surface gravity wave field and the larger-scale turbulent motions within the mixed layer. They are sometimes called windrows because they form lines of surface debris or bubbles in their surface convergence zones. Their spatial scale is related to the depth of the mixed layer and their characteristic velocity is on the order of 8u*, where u* is the friction velocity in water. As a result of this scaling, Langmuir circulations generally require surface winds of at least 8 m s-1 in order to form. See coherent structures, longitudinal rolls."@en .

sophso:Fault rdfs:comment "In geology, a fault or fault line is a planar rock fracture, which shows evidence of relative movement. Large faults within the Earth's crust are the result of shear motion and active fault zones are the causal locations of most earthquakes. Earthquakes are caused by energy release during rapid slippage along faults. The largest examples are at tectonic plate boundaries but many faults occur far from active plate boundaries. Since faults do not usually consist of a single, clean fracture, the term fault zone is used when referring to the zone of complex deformation that is associated with the fault plane."@en .

The existence of these waves was predicted by John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh, in 1885. They are slower than body waves, roughly 70% of the velocity of S waves, and have been asserted to be visible during an earthquake in an open space like a parking lot where the cars move up and down with the waves. Reports among seismologists suggest that the apparent motion may be due to distortion of the human eye during shaking. Anecdotally, placing people on shake tables causes the room to appear to ripple.

soreabb:CoralReef rdfs:comment "The term coral reef generally refers to a marine ecosystem in which the main organisms are corals that house algal symbionts within their tissues. These ecosystems require: 1) fully marine waters; 2) warm temperatures; and 3) ample sunlight. They are therefore restricted to shallow waters of tropical and subtropical regions. Corals that do not have algal symbionts can also form significant reef communities in deeper, darker, and colder waters, but these communities are distinguished as cold-water coral bioherms. The more technical definition of coral reef includes an additional geological requirement that the reef organisms produce enough calcium carbonate to build the physical reef structure. The coral reef community lives only on the surface veneer of the reef, on top of already existing skeletal material left behind by previous reef-builders. Many processes act to break down the skeletal material and reef as soon it is laid down by organisms. These include mechanical processes such as waves and currents, and a wide array of biological processes (e.g., bioerosion). Some of the best known bioeroders are large organisms such as parrotfish and sponges, but much of the bioerosion occurs at the microscopic scale by organisms such as algae and fungi. A coral reef is produced only if the coral reef community produces more calcium carbonate than is removed. Indeed, some coral reef communities grow too slowly to build a reef."@en .

soreabb:Savanna rdfs:comment "A savanna or savannah is a tropical or subtropical woodland ecosystem. Savannas are characterised by the trees being sufficiently small or widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. It is often believed that savannas are characterized by widely spaced, scattered trees, however in many savanna communities tree densities are higher and trees are more regularly spaced than in forest communities. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of C4 grasses. Savannas are also characterised by seasonal water availability, with the majority of rainfall being confined to one season of the year. Savannas can be associated with several types of biomes. Savannas are frequently seen as a transitional zone, occurring between forest regions and desert regions."@en .

soreahb:Channel rdfs:comment "In physical geography, a channel is the physical confine of a river, slough or ocean strait consisting of a bed and banks. A channel is also the natural or man-made deeper course through a reef, bar, bay, or any shallow body of water. It is especially used as a Nautical term to mean the dredged and marked lane of safe travel which a cognizant governmental entity guarantees to have a minimum depth across its specified minimum width to all vessels transiting a body of water. The term not only includes the deep-dredged ship-navigable parts of an estuary or river leading to port facilities, but also to lesser channels accessing boat port-facilities such as marinas. When dredged channels traverse bay mud or sandy bottoms, repeated dredging is often necessary because of the unstable subsequent movement of benthic soils."@en .

soreahb:Estuary rdfs:comment "An estuary is a semi-enclosed coastal body of water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea. Estuaries are often associated with high rates of biological productivity. An estuary is where the river meets the sea. An estuary is typically the tidal mouth of a river, and estuaries are often characterized by sedimentation or silt carried in from terrestrial runoff and, frequently, from offshore. They are made up of brackish water. Estuaries are more likely to occur on submerged coasts, where the sea level has risen in relation to the land; this process floods valleys to form rias and fjords. These can become estuaries if there is a stream or river flowing into them."@en .

soreahb:Fjord rdfs:comment "A fjord (or fiord) is a long, narrow estuary with steep sides, made when a glacial valley is filled by rising sea water levels. The seeds of a fjord are laid when a glacier cuts a U-shaped valley through abrasion of the surrounding bedrock by the sediment it carries. Many such valleys were formed during recent ice age when the sea was at a much lower level than it is today. At the end of the ice age, the climate warmed up again and glaciers retreated. Sea level rose due to an influx of water from melting ice sheets and glaciers around the world (it rose over 100 m after the last ice age), inundating the vacated valleys with seawater to form fjords."@en .

soreahb:Inlet rdfs:comment "An inlet is a narrow body between islands or leading inland from a larger body of water, often leading to an enclosed body of water, such as a sound, bay, lagoon or marsh.

Lagoons that are fed by freshwater streams are also called estuaries"@en .

soreahb:Marsh rdfs:comment "In geography, a marsh, or morass, is a type of wetland which is subject to frequent or continuous inundation. Typically a marsh features grasses, rushes, reeds, typhas, sedges, and other herbaceous plants (possibly with low-growing woody plants) in a context of shallow water. A marsh is different from a swamp, which has a greater proportion of open water surface, and is generally deeper than a marsh.

soreahb:Stream rdfs:comment "A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks. Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in aquifer recharge, and corridors for fish and wildlife migration. The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone. Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction event, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity. Stream is also an umbrella term used in the scientific community for all flowing natural waters, regardless of size. The study of streams and waterways in general is known as surface hydrology and is a core element of environmental geography"@en .

soreahb:Swamp rdfs:comment "A swamp is a wetland that features temporary or permanent inundation of large areas of land by shallow bodies of water, generally with a substantial number of hammocks, or dry-land protrusions, and covered by aquatic vegetation, or vegetation that tolerates periodical inundation.The water of a swamp may be fresh water or salt water. A swamp is also generally defined as having no substantial peat deposits."@en .

soreahb:Wetland rdfs:comment "In physical geography, a wetland is an environment at the interface between truly terrestrial ecosystems and aquatic systems making them inherently different from each other yet highly dependent on both. In essence, wetlands are ecotones. Wetlands often host considerable biodiversity and endemism. The US Army Corps of Engineers and the US Environmental Protection Agency jointly define wetlands as: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas."@en .

A dune field is an area covered by extensive sand dunes. Large dune fields are known as ergs."@en .

sorealc:Beach rdfs:comment "A beach, or strand, is a geological landform consisting of loose rock particles - such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, cobble - or even shell fragments, along the shoreline of a body of water. Beaches occur along coastal areas, where wave or current action deposits and reworks sediments, or at the margin of land along a lake or river subject to erosion caused by rainfall. Beaches are not necessarily found in conjunction with salt water, such as the ocean, in all instances. A seashore beach is merely one type of beach but it is the most commonly associated with the perception of the word beach."@en .

sorealc:Delta rdfs:comment "A delta is a landform where the mouth of a river flows into an ocean, sea, desert, estuary, lake or another river. It builds up sediment outwards into the flat area which the river's flow encounters (as a deltaic deposit) transported by the water and set down as the currents slow. Deltaic deposits of larger, heavily-laden rivers are characterized by the main channel dividing amongst often substantial land masses into multiple streams known as distributaries. These divide and come together again to form a maze of active and inactive channels."@en .

sorealc:Riparian rdfs:comment "A riparian zone is the interface between land and a flowing surface water body. Plant communities along the river margins are called riparian vegetation, characterized by hydrophilic plants. Riparian zones are significant in ecology, environmental management, and civil engineering due to their role in soil conservation, their biodiversity, and the influence they have on aquatic ecosystems. Riparian zones occur in many forms including grassland, woodland, wetland or even non-vegetative. In some regions the terms riparian woodland, riparian forest, riparian buffer zone or riparian strip are used to characterize a riparian zone."@en .

sorealc:Shoal rdfs:comment "A shoal is a somewhat linear landform within or extending into a body of water, typically comprised of sand, silt or small pebbles. Alternatively termed sandbar or sandbank, a bar is characteristically long and narrow (linear) and develops where a stream or ocean current promote deposition of granular material, resulting in localized shallowing (shoaling) of the water. Bars can appear in the sea, in a lake, or in a river. Alternatively a bar may separate a lake from the sea, as in the case of an ayre. They are typically composed of sand, although could be of any granular matter that the moving water has access to and is capable of shifting around (for example, soil, silt, gravel, cobble, shingle, or even boulders). The grain size of the material comprising a bar is related to the size of the waves or the strength of the currents moving the material, but the availability of material to be worked by waves and currents is also important."@en .

Geothermal is technically an adjective (e.g., geothermal energy) but in U.S. English the word has attained frequent use as a noun (otherwise expressed as g. heat, g. source, or geotherm). The planet's internal heat was originally generated during its accretion, due to gravitational binding energy, and since then additional heat has continued to be generated by the radioactive decay of elements such as uranium, thorium, and potassium.

soreao:AphoticZone rdfs:comment "The aphotic zone is the portion of a lake or ocean where there is little or no sunlight. It is formally defined as the depths beyond which less than 1% of sunlight penetrates. Consequently, bioluminescence is essentially the only light found in this zone. Most food comes from dead organisms sinking to the bottom of the lake or ocean from other zones.

soreaofl:MidOceanRidge rdfs:comment "A mid-ocean ridge or mid-oceanic ridge is an underwater mountain range, formed by plate tectonics. This uplifting of the ocean floor occurs when convection currents rise in the mantle beneath the oceanic crust and create magma where two tectonic plates meet at a divergent boundary. The mid-ocean ridges of the world are connected and form a single global mid-oceanic ridge system that is part of every ocean, making the mid-oceanic ridge system the longest mountain range in the world."@en .

soreaofl:Seamount rdfs:comment "A seamount is a mountain rising from the ocean seafloor that does not reach to the water's surface (sea level), and thus is not an island. These are typically formed from extinct volcanoes, that rise abruptly and are usually found rising from a seafloor of 1,000 - 4,000 meters depth. They are defined by oceanographers as independent features that rise to at least 1,000 meters above the seafloor. The peaks are often found hundreds to thousands of meters below the surface, and are therefore considered to be within the deep sea.[1] An estimated 30,000 seamounts occur across the globe, with only a few having been studied. However, some seamounts are also unusual."@en .

soreaofl:SubmarineCanyon rdfs:comment "A submarine canyon is a steep-sided valley on the sea floor of the continental slope. Many submarine canyons are found as extensions to large rivers; however there are many that have no such association.
